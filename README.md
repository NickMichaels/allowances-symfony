# allowances-symfony
A simplified allowances app to track an allowance balance

# Initial Requirements
Allowances App  
* Make an application to store allowance information, given that :
* A child accrues allowance at a different weekly rate, based on their age.
* Each child has a Spend, Save and Give “bucket” or account, with the ability to define how much weekly allowance goes into each bucket. Let's just make a button to simulate a week passing for now
* Add the ability to submit withdrawals from each account
* Add a dashboard that shows Spend, Save and Give balances for a child
